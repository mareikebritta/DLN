# Bold and Italics

## Bold

To put text in bold, use two asterisks: **This is a bold text**

I think you can use underscores as well: __This is also bold__

If you want to type "\*" on its own, you need to lead it with \\ 

## Italicise

Just use a single asterisk or underscore: *this is italicised*

_This is also italicised_

## Combination of both

You can combine both **bold** and *italics* by using combination of underscores and asterisk: _**This text is italicised and bolded**_

# Line Ruling

You can rule lines like this:

---

Or like this:

___
